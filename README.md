# ImageClassifierAWSUdacityScholarship
This repository is created for demonstrating the skills obtained during the AWS AI & ML Scholarship partnered with Udacity. (https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/awsaiml-win22/home)

Jupyter notebook file (Image Classifier Project Scholarship Submission.ipynb) contains the python code for training a computer vision deep learning model that uses a pretrained densenet161 architecture.

The SOTA version shows the steps for the development of a SOTA (State of the Art) model with Swin Transformer architecture that is trained with 224 x 224 pixel images. Current state of the art is trained with 384 x 384 pixel images.

The train and predict files are command line application tools that can be run in local clusters to train and predict images locally, although they won't be able to replicate the SOTA results, since they are designed to work on earlier versions of python and pytorch environments.
